# A UNIX-style shell

Part of coursework at BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus.

## Code Style

* KNR-style bracing (all braces start on same line)
* 4-space tabs for indentation!

Would strongly recommend http://www.sublimetext.com/
as a primary text-editor. Quite frankly, it kicks ass.

## Documentation Style

Java-style HTML documentation using Doxygen.
For example usage: 
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html

## Branching Protocol

For *any change* that you want to make, create a 
separate branch named as per the following convention:

**fix_***bugfix_name* *or* **feature_***bugfix_name*

Then, create a new **pull request**, during which you
should add *at least one other team member* who will
review your code before merging it in. This acts like
an inbuilt code-review process.

**Important Note on Merge Conflicts:** Thou shalt resolve
thy own merge conflicts and not expect thy reviewer to
do so.
